# Leaflet-Tutorial

This is series of tutorials how to use Leaflet with Nodejs. To install one of the tutorials just copy them into any folder and execute `npm start` within the folder in your console.
I am using Browserify and Beefy to start the tutorials on the localhost. If you do so as well, you will find it on <http://localhost:9966/> in your machine.

Note: Make sure you have already installed Nodejs and NPM.

#### 001-Leaflet-Base-Layers:

This first tutorial shows a few possible base layers you can use with Leaflet.

#### 002-Leaflet-Interactive-Geojson:

This second tutorial shows how to integrate an interactive Geojson layer. The example data is a geojson of the Austrian states. If you hover over a state, the name appears in a small info control on the right bottom.
