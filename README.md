# Leaflet-Tutorial
This is series of tutorials how to use Leaflet with Nodejs. To install one of the tutorials just copy them into any folder and execute `npm start` within the folder in your console.
I am using Browserify and Beefy to start the tutorials on the localhost. If you do so as well, you will find it on <http://localhost:9966/> in your machine.

#### 001-Leaflet-Base-Layers:

This first tutorial shows a few possible base layers you can use with Leaflet.
